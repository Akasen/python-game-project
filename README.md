# About
This is a simple little project I am working on here and there whenever I am bored and just alone with my phone. I am coding all this with the app "Acode" along with the usage of Termux for git commits and pushes along with python testing.

I am also just experimenting with treating classes as if they were structs in C, so no methods in the classes.

At the moment (2025-09-08), there is no real clear end goal with this project. I am just adding to it as ideas come to me and as I research certain topics.
